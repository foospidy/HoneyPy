## Overview

HoneyPy comes with a lot of plugins included. The level of interaction is determined by the functionality of the used 
plugin. Plugins can be created to emulate UDP or TCP based services to provide more interaction. All activity is logged 
to a file by default, but posting honeypot activity to Twitter or a web service endpoint can be configured as well. 

**Examples**:
* Plugins:
    * ElasticSearch
    * SIP
    * etc.
    
* Loggers:
    * HoneyDB
    * Twitter
    * etc.
